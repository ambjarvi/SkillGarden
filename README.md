# SkillGarden
## Purpose
This project aims to create a mobile/web application that teaches users how to garden through short, interactive lessons. Think “Duolingo, but for gardening.” The app will guide beginners through different plant types, gardening skills, and routines.

## High-Level Goals
&rarr; Make gardening accessible and easy to learn
&rarr; Provide structured lesson paths (e.g., Herbs, Vegetables, Houseplants)
&rarr; Teach through small, gamified modules
&rarr; Track user progress
&rarr; Allow future expandability into other hobbies/skills
